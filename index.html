    Q1) List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
<br>   NODE JS:
<br>Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
“location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
<br>Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
“require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
<br>Browser js(Console) :
“window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
“location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
“document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
<br>Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.
<br>Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers.

<br>Q2) watch & summary 5 points - <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConf
<br>Ans: 
<br>1)	 Parsing HTML:
HTML  is forgiving by nature
Parsing isn’t straight forward
Can be halted
Will do speculative parsing
Its reentrant
<br>2)	script,link & style
Will halt the parser as a script can alter the document
Network latency
link & style could halt js execution
<br>3)
	<!-- <script/> at the bottom -->
     Parse uninterrupted
    Faster to render
    defer and async attributes
    Trade  off
    <br>4)	DOM Node to RenderObject
Visual output
Geometric info
Can layout and paint
Hold style & computed matrices
<br>5)	Calculating visual properties
Combines all styles
defaults, external, style elements & inline
complexity around matching rules for each element
Style computation

<br>Q4) Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
<br>a.	typeof(1)---- number
<br>b.	typeof(1.1)----number
<br>c.	typeof('1.1')-----string
<br>d.	typeof(true)------boolean
<br>e.	typeof(null)------object
<br>f.	typeof(undefined)-----undefined
<br>g.	typeof([])------object
<br>h.	typeof({})------object
<br>i.	typeof(NaN)------number
